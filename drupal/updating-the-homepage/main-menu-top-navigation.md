You can add, replace, move or delete items as you wish. Menu items can be enabled/disabled as well as translated.

After any change in the order and parenting of menu item, you will need to save the new configuration.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: There is no draft mode on the navigation. Any change goes live directly. Only 2 levels are shown in the main navigation per template.
{% endhint %}
