# Known limitations

* Images cannot be translated. Multilingual sites must use the same image to promote a given page. For different images, different pages will be necessary
* Super and subscript are not possible in the titles. They are usually replaced by the same in parenthesis \(i.e. \(R\) or \(TM\)\)
* Site logo is managed at a template level, to which we currently do not have access
* There is a delay between prod and live sites
* Most views are shared across Novartis sites, and should not be updated/changed on a site basis â€“ Commercial IT should be contacted in case of any issue
* The news archive takes a very long time to get updated. Longest seen to date: 4 days \(usually a couple hours\)
